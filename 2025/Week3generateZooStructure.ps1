Hi,

Welcome to Week 3 of the FNB App Academy!

By now, you‚Äôve explored the foundations of app development with HTML and CSS‚Äîand even built your first app. That‚Äôs a big milestone, so well done! But there‚Äôs still a lot more power to unlock in these two tools.

In last Friday‚Äôs live lecture, we walked through the Software Development Life Cycle, using our case study app, Pine City Zoo, to explore how developers go from an idea to a full-fledged app. It‚Äôs all about planning, designing, and thinking ahead‚Äîjust like a real dev team would.

Now it‚Äôs your turn.

This week, you‚Äôll be building your own version of the Pine City Zoo app. Some parts of it will challenge you, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Take your time, revisit the lessons as often as needed, and don‚Äôt rush. You‚Äôre not just coding‚Äîyou‚Äôre developing real-world skills.

Make sure to complete all of this week‚Äôs lessons before next week‚Äôs lessons are sent out in order to avoid falling behind.

Coming Up Tomorrow: UX/UI Design

In Tuesday‚Äôs session, we‚Äôll dive into User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design.

UI is what your users see‚Äîthe layout, buttons, and navigation. UX is what they feel‚Äîhow intuitive, smooth, or frustrating that experience is. A well-designed app isn‚Äôt just good-looking; it guides users naturally and helps them get what they need, effortlessly.

You‚Äôll learn how to spot bad UX, what makes great UX, and how to design a UI that‚Äôs simple, functional, and beautiful. We‚Äôll continue using the Pine City Zoo app to show real-world examples in action.

Tomorrow‚Äôs session starts at 11:00. Tune in on the App of the Year Site or YouTube channel.

Tips to make the most of this lesson:
- Watch all the videos once
- Watch them a second time
- In the second time, follow as you learn

In the next few lessons, we will be learning how to build the "Pine City Zoo" App. It serves as a tour guide for a fictional zoo.


## üì¶ Automated Generator Script: `Week3generateZooStructure.ps1`

This commit introduces a PowerShell script that automatically sets up the complete directory structure for the Pine City Zoo learning content.

### üîß What it does:
- Creates folders for `Section 1` through `Section 4`, each containing `Lesson 1` through `Lesson 21`.
- Adds subfolders: `css/` and `images/` to each lesson.
- Copies image files into each `images/` directory.
- Generates a basic `index.html` file for each lesson with an embedded layout.
- Adds a `.gitkeep` file to preserve empty folders in Git.
- Includes an empty `README.md` file in every section and lesson folder.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use It:

1. **Ensure images are placed in this path relative to the script location:**

   The path should be within the project folder, named `data`, which contains the content from Week 1 to the rest of the weeks sent via email. It should look like this:
   `../Data/AppAcademyWeek3-main/AppAcademyWeek3-main/pineCityZooImages/images/`.

   ‚úÖ This folder should contain image files such as:
   `logo.png`, `map.png`, and other image formats like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.webp`.

2. **Open PowerShell** in the directory where `Week3generateZooStructure.ps1` is located.

3. **Run the script:**

   ```powershell
   ./Week3generateZooStructure.ps1
   ```

This will create the entire folder structure, copy the images to their respective locations, and ensure they are easily accessible. If you encounter a script execution error, make sure that PowerShell is allowed to run local scripts by executing the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

### Example Directory Structure:
```
Section 1/
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Lesson 1/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitkeep
```
