# Organizing Your Images

To add images to your web page, it is best practice to create a dedicated folder named `images`. While not strictly required, organizing all your images in this folder makes them much easier to locate and manage.

You can download the necessary images from the following link:

After downloading, place the images inside the `Lesson 1` folder. Since we will be working through Section 2 and Section 3 step by step, ensure that the images are available in each relevant folder. This approach will streamline your workflow as you progress through each section.
