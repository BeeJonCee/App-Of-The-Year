### Lesson 2: External CSS File

This lesson will teach you how to style your pages using a Cascade Style Sheet. All the styling information for your website or app will live in a file called `style.css`.

1. Create a `style.css` file.
2. Link it to your `index.html` file. This is done using the code below, placed between the `<head>` tags.

**HTML Code:**
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

**CSS Code:**
```css
h1 {
  color: green;
}
p {
  color: coral;
}
```
