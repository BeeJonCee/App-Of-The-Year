# Introduction to CSS

## What is CSS?

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a simple design language used to make web pages visually appealing and presentable.

With CSS, you can control the colors, fonts, layouts, and background images of your website.

CSS is different from HTML. While HTML creates the structure of your page, CSS adds colors, styles, and visual enhancements.
